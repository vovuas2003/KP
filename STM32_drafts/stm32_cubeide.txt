I didn't use cubeide, so did't check this guide.

!!!Upgrade ST-Link V2 programmer firmware from stsw folder
!!!Install driver for programmer from en.stsw folder (dpinst amd for win64)

Install from exe.
Start new project.
Part number: stm32f103c8t6 (blue pill, in cubeide it is maybe ...c8tx).
Name your project.
Open perspective (yes).
Pinout -> system core -> sys -> debug -> serial wire.
Set necessary pins.
Save (crtl+S or icon up left corner). Yes, yes.
Edit main.c (crtl+space is auto-completion), save.
Build (build "debug" icon is right from save icon). It is compilation.
Don't forget to connect stm32 blue pill board via USB ST-Link V2 programmer.
Run (green icon). It is uploading code into stm23 blue pill board.
Debugger -> debug probe -> OpenOCD.
Show generation options (in debugger) -> reset mode -> software system reset.
Apply, ok, wait a bit (until "shutdown command invoked").
